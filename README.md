# SwiftUISlots
Simple game of slots

This is a simple game of slots that reacts to the spin button and dynamically updates state properties such as the score, colors, etc.

This was one of my first projects in Swift/SwiftUI so it's not organized in an MVVM pattern. It simply conducts all functionality and
view out of the ContentView file.
